            Rose oil, also known as rose otto or attar of roses, is a highly
            valued essential oil derived from the petals of the Rosa damascena
            plant. It is known for its sweet, floral aroma and its use in
            perfumery, aromatherapy, and skincare products. Rose oil is obtained
            through steam distillation of the freshly picked petals, a process
            that captures the delicate fragrance of the roses. The oil is also
            prized for its therapeutic properties, as it is believed to have a
            calming and soothing effect on the mind and body.

          <p class="purpose-body">
            Starting an essential oil company was a journey filled with passion
            and determination for me. It all started when I became interested in
            the benefits of natural remedies and began using essential oils in
            my daily life. I was impressed by the positive effects they had on
            my health and well-being, and I was inspired to share these benefits
            with others. After extensive research and planning, I decided to
            launch my own essential oil company, with the goal of providing
            high-quality, pure, and natural oils to people looking for natural
            solution.
